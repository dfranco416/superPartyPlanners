The project was named SuperPartyPlannerz, and it was a hack-a-thon over four days and we were to showcase our knowledge of Software Development.
It was a 2 person team effort with Quanda Moore and David Franco. This is a web application for event/party reservations. 
The users would enter their name, the date and time they would like to request the event and the theme of their event. 
The vision was to have a front end as well using a third party API, however, that proved to be more of a challenge. 
The challenge with using the particular api we chose is that there were OAuth, key and token issues that were really out of the scope of our learning at the time. 
We used Springboot for the programming, Postman for testing and verification of the web service and it was successful. 
We attempted to use Thymeleaf for our front end design and user input, which we were excited about using. 
Due to the time left for our project we could not contiue to build for the front end or perfrom any testing to ensure our code worked the way we designed. 
We both agreed that developing software as well as web applicaitons is a very involved process and that it takes a lot of time, trial and error, although the end goal is to have a great application.
